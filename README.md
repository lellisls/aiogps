# aiogps
Library to interface with gpsd using asyncio

Warning! Not much test has been done on this. It works for me on my gps tracker project, tought it will be useful for others.

It's just slight modifications (like 15 lines or so) to the code forked from here: https://github.com/tommyjcarpenter/gps-python3
